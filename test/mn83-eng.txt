<div class="a"><font color="#996633" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Then in a certain place the Blessed One smiled. It occurred to the venerable Ānanda: "What is the reason, what is the cause, for the Blessed One's smile? Tathāgatas do not smile for no reason." So he arranged his upper robe on one shoulder, and extending his hands in reverential salutation towards the Blessed One, he asked him: "Venerable sir, what is the reason, what is the cause, for the Blessed One's smile? Tathāgatas do not smile for no reason."</i></font></div>

<div class="a"><font color="#996633" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i> "Once, Ānanda, in this same Mithilā there was a king named Makhādeva.

He conducted himself by the Dhamma among brahmins and householders, among town-dwellers and countryfolk, and he observed the Uposatha days on the fourteenth, fifteenth, and eighth of the fortnight.</i></font></div>

When he saw them, he said to the king: ‘The divine messengers have appeared, sire; grey hairs are to be seen growing on your majesty's head.’—‘Then, good barber, pull out those grey hairs carefully with tweezers and put them in my palm.’—‘Yes, sire,’ he replied, and he pulled out those grey hairs carefully with tweezers and put them in the king's palm.</i></font></div>

I shall shave off my hair and beard, put on the yellow robe, and go forth from the home life into homelessness. And now, dear prince, when you too see grey hairs growing on your head, then after giving the boon of a village to your barber, and after carefully instructing the prince, your eldest son, in kingship, shave off your hair and beard, put on the yellow robe, and go forth from the home life into homelessness. Continue this good practice instituted by me and do not be the last man.
