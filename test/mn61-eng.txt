Then, when it was evening, the Blessed One rose from meditation and went to the venerable Rāhula at Ambalaṭṭhikā. The venerable Rāhula saw the Blessed One coming in the distance and made a seat ready and set out water for washing the feet. The Blessed One sat down on the seat made ready and washed his feet. The venerable Rāhula paid homage to him and sat down at one side.</i></font></div>

<div class="a"><font color="#996633" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i> Then the Blessed One left a little water in the water vessel and asked the venerable Rāhula: "Rāhula, do you see this little water left in the water vessel?"—"Yes, venerable sir."—"Even so little, Rāhula, is the recluseship of those who are not ashamed to tell a deliberate lie."</i></font></div>

<div class="a"><font color="#996633" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Then the Blessed One threw away the little water that was left and asked the venerable Rāhula: "Rāhula, do you see that little water that was thrown away?"—"Yes, venerable sir."—"Even so, Rāhula, those who are not ashamed to tell a deliberate lie have thrown away their recluseship."</i></font></div>

<div class="a"><font color="#996633" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Then the Blessed One turned the water vessel upside down and asked the venerable Rāhula: "Rāhula, do you see this water vessel turned upside down?"—"Yes, venerable sir."—"Even so, Rāhula, those who are not ashamed to tell a deliberate lie have turned their recluseship upside down."</i></font></div>

Then his rider would think: ‘This royal tusker elephant with tusks as long as chariot poles … performs his task in battle with his forefeet and his hindfeet … yet he keeps back his trunk. He has not yet given up his life.’ But when the royal tusker elephant … performs his task in battle with his forefeet and his hindfeet, with his forequarters and his hindquarters, with his head and his ears, with his tusks and his tail, and also with his trunk, then his rider would think: ‘This royal tusker elephant with tusks as long as chariot poles … performs his task in battle with his forefeet and his hindfeet … and also with his trunk. He has given up his life. Now there is nothing this royal tusker elephant would not do.’ So too, Rāhula, when one is not ashamed to tell a deliberate lie, there is no evil, I say, that one would not do.
