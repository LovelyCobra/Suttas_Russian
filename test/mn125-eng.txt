<div class="a"><font color="#996633" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i> "Master Aggivessana, I have heard that a bhikkhu who abides here diligent, ardent, and resolute can achieve unification of mind."</i></font></div>

<div class="a"><font color="#996633" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>"Let Master Aggivessana teach me the Dhamma as he has heard it and mastered it. Perhaps I can understand the meaning of his words."</i></font></div>

<div class="a"><font color="#996633" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i> Then the novice Aciravata taught Prince Jayasena the Dhamma as he had heard it and mastered it. After he had spoken, Prince Jayasena remarked: "It is impossible, Master Aggivessana, it cannot happen that a bhikkhu who abides diligent, ardent, and resolute can achieve unification of mind." Then, having declared to the novice Aciravata that this was impossible and could not happen, Prince Jayasena rose from his seat and departed.</i></font></div>

<div class="a"><font color="#996633" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i> Soon after Prince Jayasena had left, the novice Aciravata went to the Blessed One.

<div class="a"><font color="#996633" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i> "Aggivessana, how is it possible that Prince Jayasena, living in the midst of sensual pleasures, enjoying sensual pleasures, being devoured by thoughts of sensual pleasures, being consumed by the fever of sensual pleasures, bent on the search for sensual pleasures, could know, see, or realise that which must be known through renunciation, seen through renunciation, attained through renunciation, realised through renunciation? That is impossible.</i></font></div>

<div class="a"><font color="#996633" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i> "Suppose, Aggivessana, there were two tamable elephants, horses, or oxen that were well tamed and well disciplined, and two tamable elephants, horses, or oxen that were untamed and undisciplined.

Then the friend who remained below at the foot of the mountain would say to the friend who stood on the top: ‘Well, friend, what do you see, standing on top of the mountain?’ And the other replied: ‘Standing on top of the mountain, friend, I see lovely parks, lovely groves, lovely meadows, and lovely ponds.’ Then the first friend would say: ‘It is impossible, friend, it cannot happen that while standing on top of the mountain you should see lovely parks, lovely groves, lovely meadows, and lovely ponds.’</i></font></div>

<div class="a"><font color="#996633" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i> "Then the other friend would come down to the foot of the mountain, take his friend by the arm, and make him climb to the top of the mountain.

<div class="a"><font color="#996633" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>"So too, Aggivessana, Prince Jayasena is obstructed, hindered, blocked, and enveloped by a still greater mass than this—the mass of ignorance.

He ties a giant plank to his trunk; a man with a lance in his hand sits on his neck; men with lances in their hands surround him on all sides; and the elephant tamer himself stands in front of him holding a long lance pole. When the elephant is being trained in the task of imperturbability, he does not move his forelegs or his hindlegs; he does not move his forequarters or his hindquarters; he does not move his head, ears, tusks, tail, or trunk.
