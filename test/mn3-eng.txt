<div class="a"><font color="#996633" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i> Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was living in Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park. There he addressed the bhikkhus thus: "Bhikkhus."—"Venerable sir," they replied. The Blessed One said this:</i></font></div>

<div class="a"><font color="#996633" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i> "Bhikkhus, be my heirs in Dhamma, not my heirs in material things. Out of compassion for you I have thought: ‘How shall my disciples be my heirs in Dhamma, not my heirs in material things?’ If you are my heirs in material things, not my heirs in Dhamma, you will be reproached thus: ‘The Teacher's disciples live as his heirs in material things, not as heirs in Dhamma’; and I will be reproached thus: ‘The Teacher's disciples live as his heirs in material things, not as his heirs in Dhamma.’</i></font></div>

<div class="a"><font color="#996633" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>"If you are my heirs in Dhamma, not my heirs in material things, you will not be reproached as it will be said: ‘The Teacher's disciples live as his heirs in Dhamma, not as his heirs in material things’; and I will not be reproached as it will be said: ‘The Teacher's disciples live as his heirs in Dhamma, not as his heirs in material things.’ Therefore, bhikkhus, be my heirs in Dhamma, not my heirs in material things. Out of compassion for you I have thought: ‘How shall my disciples be my heirs in Dhamma, not my heirs in material things?’</i></font></div>

<div class="a"><font color="#996633" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i> "Now, bhikkhus, suppose that I had eaten, refused more food, had my fill, finished, had enough, had what I needed, and some almsfood was left over to be thrown away. Then two bhikkhus arrived hungry and weak, and I told them: ‘Bhikkhus, I have eaten … had what I needed, but there is this almsfood of mine left over to be thrown away. Eat if you like; if you do not eat then I shall throw it away where there is no greenery or drop it into water where there is no life.’ </i></font></div>

<div class="a"><font color="#996633" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i> Then one bhikkhu thought: ‘The Blessed One has eaten … had what he needed, but there is this almsfood of the Blessed One left over to be thrown away; if we do not eat it the Blessed One will throw it away … But this has been said by the Blessed One: "Bhikkhus, be my heirs in Dhamma, not my heirs in material things." Now this almsfood is one of the material things. Suppose that instead of eating this almsfood I pass the night and day hungry and weak.’ And instead of eating that almsfood he passed that night and day hungry and weak. </i></font></div>

<div class="a"><font color="#996633" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i> Then the second bhikkhu thought: ‘The Blessed One has eaten … had what he needed, but there is this almsfood of the Blessed One left over to be thrown away … Suppose that I eat this almsfood and pass the night and day neither hungry nor weak.’ And after eating that almsfood he passed the night and day neither hungry nor weak.</i></font></div>

<div class="a"><font color="#996633" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i> Now although that bhikkhu by eating that almsfood passed the night and day neither hungry nor weak, yet the first bhikkhu is more to be respected and commended by me. Why is that? Because that will for long conduce to his fewness of wishes, contentment, effacement, easy support, and arousal of energy. Therefore, bhikkhus, be my heirs in Dhamma, not my heirs in material things. Out of compassion for you I have thought: ‘How shall my disciples be my heirs in Dhamma, not my heirs in material things?’"</i></font></div>
