<div class="a"><font color="#996633" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i> Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was living in the Bhagga country at Suṁsumāragira in the Bhesakaḷā Grove, the Deer Park.</i></font></div>

<div class="a"><font color="#996633" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Now on that occasion a palace named Kokanada had recently been built for Prince Bodhi, and it had not yet been inhabited by any recluse or brahmin or any human being at all.</i></font></div>

<div class="a"><font color="#996633" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Then Prince Bodhi addressed the brahmin student Sañjikāputta thus: "Come, my dear Sañjikāputta, go to the Blessed One and pay homage in my name with your head at his feet, and ask whether he is free from illness and affliction and is healthy, strong, and abiding in comfort, saying: ‘Venerable sir, Prince Bodhi pays homage with his head at the Blessed One's feet, and he asks whether the Blessed One is free from illness … and abiding in comfort.’ Then say this: ‘Venerable sir, let the Blessed One together with the Sangha of bhikkhus consent to accept tomorrow's meal from Prince Bodhi.’"</i></font></div>

<div class="a"><font color="#996633" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>"Yes, sir," Sañjikāputta replied, and he went to the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him. When this courteous and amiable talk was finished, he sat down at one side and said: "Master Gotama, Prince Bodhi pays homage with his head at Master Gotama's feet and asks whether he is free from illness … and abiding in comfort. And he says this: ‘Let Master Gotama together with the Sangha of bhikkhus consent to accept tomorrow's meal from Prince Bodhi.’" The Blessed One consented in silence. </i></font></div>

<div class="a"><font color="#996633" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i> Then, knowing that the Blessed One had consented, Sañjikāputta rose from his seat, went to Prince Bodhi, and told him what had happened , adding: "The recluse Gotama has consented."</i></font></div>

<div class="a"><font color="#996633" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i> Then, when the night had ended, Prince Bodhi had good food of various kinds prepared in his own residence, and he had the Kokanada Palace spread with white cloth down to the last step of the staircase. Then he addressed the brahmin student Sañjikāputta thus: "Come, my dear Sañjikāputta, go to the Blessed One and announce that it is time thus: ‘It is time, venerable sir, the meal is ready.’"</i></font></div>

<div class="a"><font color="#996633" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>"Yes, sir," Sañjikāputta replied, and he went to the Blessed One and announced that it was time thus: "It is time, Master Gotama, the meal is ready."</i></font></div>

<div class="a"><font color="#996633" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i> Then, it being morning, the Blessed One dressed, and taking his bowl and outer robe, went to Prince Bodhi's residence.</i></font></div>

<div class="a"><font color="#996633" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Now on that occasion Prince Bodhi was standing in the outer porch waiting for the Blessed One. When he saw the Blessed One coming in the distance, he went out to meet him and paid homage to him; and then, allowing the Blessed One to precede him, he proceeded to the Kokanada Palace. But the Blessed One stopped at the lowest step of the staircase. Prince Bodhi said to him: "Venerable sir, let the Blessed One step on the cloth, let the Sublime One step on the cloth, that it may lead to my welfare and happiness for a long time." When this was said, the Blessed One was silent.</i></font></div>

<div class="a"><font color="#996633" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>A second time…A third time Prince Bodhi said to him: "Venerable sir, let the Blessed One step on the cloth, let the Sublime One step on the cloth, that it may lead to my welfare and happiness for a long time."</i></font></div>

<div class="a"><font color="#996633" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i> The Blessed One looked at the venerable Ānanda. The venerable Ānanda said to Prince Bodhi: "Prince, let the cloth be removed. The Blessed One will not step on a strip of cloth; the Tathāgata has regard for future generations."</i></font></div>

<div class="a"><font color="#996633" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>So Prince Bodhi had the cloth removed, and he had seats prepared in the upper apartments of the Kokanada Palace. The Blessed One and the Sangha of bhikkhus ascended the Kokanada Palace and sat down on the seats that had been prepared.</i></font></div>

<div class="a"><font color="#996633" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Then, with his own hands, Prince Bodhi served and satisfied the Sangha of bhikkhus headed by the Buddha with the various kinds of good food. When the Blessed One had eaten and had put his bowl aside, Prince Bodhi took a low seat, sat down at one side, and said to the Blessed One: "Venerable sir, we have thought thus: ‘Pleasure is not to be gained through pleasure; pleasure is to be gained through pain.’"</i></font></div>

<div class="a"><font color="#996633" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i> "Prince, before my enlightenment, while I was still only an unenlightened Bodhisatta, I too thought thus: ‘Pleasure is not to be gained through pleasure; pleasure is to be gained through pain.’</i></font></div>
