<div class="a"><font color="#996633" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Now on that occasion a brahmin student named Assalāyana was staying at Sāvatthī.

Then the brahmins thought: "There is this young brahmin student named Assalāyana staying at Sāvatthī. Young … fully versed in natural philosophy and in the marks of a Great Man.

<div class="a"><font color="#996633" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i> So the brahmins went to the brahmin student Assalāyana and said to him: "Master Assalāyana, this recluse Gotama describes purification for all the four castes.

<div class="a"><font color="#996633" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i> When this was said, the brahmin student Assalāyana replied: "Sirs, the recluse Gotama is one who speaks the Dhamma.

<div class="a"><font color="#996633" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i> A second time the brahmins said to him: "Master Assalāyana, this recluse Gotama describes purification for all the four castes.
