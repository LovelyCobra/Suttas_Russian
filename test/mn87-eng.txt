<div class="a"><font color="#996633" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i> Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</i></font></div>

<div class="a"><font color="#996633" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Then that householder went to the Blessed One, and after paying homage to him, sat down at one side.
